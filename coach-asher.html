    <h2>Hi, I’m Coach Asher</h2>
    <p>I believe students shouldn’t just learn harder — they should learn smarter.</p>
    <p>I was working as a manager in a multinational logistics company when a health crisis changed everything. After undergoing surgery and recovering from a brain tumour, I found myself reflecting deeply on what truly mattered — and what made learning stick.</p>
    <p>During that time, I immersed myself in studying how the brain works, and discovered how children learn most effectively. That led me to the field of metacognition — the science of thinking about one’s own thinking. I realised that when students learn how to pause, plan, and process information strategically, their performance skyrockets.</p>
    <p>This insight changed everything for me — and became the foundation of my teaching philosophy.</p>
    <p>I left the corporate world to pursue my purpose: helping students unlock their full potential through cognitive coaching. At Crack the Code Learning, I now work with Primary 3 to 6 students to master English and Math using structured, brain-based strategies.</p>
    <p>Many of my students improve by 2 to 3 AL bands — not by doing endless worksheets, but by learning how to break down questions, avoid careless mistakes, and study with clarity and confidence.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #003366;">This isn’t just tuition. It’s next-gen coaching for the exam-smart generation.</p>
