    <h2>Meet Coach Asher</h2>

    <p>Hi, I’m Coach Asher, and I believe students shouldn’t just learn harder — they should learn smarter.</p>

    <p>I was working as a manager in a multinational logistics company when a major health event changed my life — I underwent surgery and recovery from a brain tumour. During that time, I immersed myself in studying how the brain works and discovered how children learn most effectively.</p>

    <p>This led me to the field of <strong>metacognition</strong> — the science of thinking about one’s own thinking. I found that when students learn how to pause, plan, and process information strategically, their performance skyrockets. That insight became the foundation of my teaching philosophy.</p>

    <p>I left the corporate world to pursue a new mission: to help students unlock their full potential through cognitive coaching. At Crack the Code Learning, I now work with Primary 3 to 6 students to master English and Math using structured, brain-based strategies.</p>

    <p>Many of my students improve by 2 to 3 AL bands — not by doing endless worksheets, but by learning how to break down questions, avoid careless mistakes, and study with clarity and confidence.</p>

    <p><em>This isn’t just tuition. It’s next-gen coaching for the exam-smart generation.</em></p>
