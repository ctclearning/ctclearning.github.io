    <h2>Meet Coach Asher</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Coach Asher, and I believe students shouldn’t just learn harder — they should learn smarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was working as a manager in a multinational logistics company. But after undergoing surgery and a recovery from a brain tumour, I found myself reflecting on what truly mattered — and what made learning stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that time, I immersed myself in studying how the brain works, and discovered how children learn most effectively. That led me to the field of metacognition — the science of thinking about one’s own thinking. I discovered that when students learn how to pause, plan, and process information strategically, their performance skyrockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      That insight changed everything for me — and became the foundation of my teaching philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the corporate world to pursue my purpose: helping students unlock their full potential through cognitive coaching. At Crack the Code Learning, I now work with Primary 3 to 6 students to master English and Math using structured, brain-based strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of my students improve by 2 to 3 AL bands — not by doing endless worksheets, but by learning how to break down questions, avoid careless mistakes, and study with clarity and confidence.
    </p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #003366;">
      This isn’t just tuition. It’s next-gen coaching for the exam-smart generation.
