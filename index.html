      <h4 style="color: #003366; margin-bottom: 16px; font-size: 1.2em;">English Made Simple, Strategic and Scoreable</h4>

      <p>At <strong>Crack the Code Learning</strong>, we believe English can be learned with clear strategies — just like Math or Science.</p>

      <p>We understand that the PSLE English paper has many components — Grammar, Comprehension, Composition, Cloze, Oral, and more. Many students feel overwhelmed not because they lack ability, but because they lack a system. That’s where we come in.</p>

      <p>Our <strong>CodeKey™ methodology</strong> gives students a structured, step-by-step way to approach every English question. Each component of the paper is broken down and taught with its own <strong>CodeKey™</strong> — a thinking tool that helps students know exactly what to look for, how to think, and how to answer with precision.</p>

      <p>Instead of relying on “gut feel” or memorisation, students learn:</p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
        <li>✅ How to spot clues in cloze and comprehension passages</li>
        <li>✅ How to apply grammar rules with confidence</li>
        <li>✅ How to structure compositions clearly and creatively</li>
        <li>✅ How to approach oral questions with depth and clarity</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We also teach students how to think, not just what to write — so they become independent, reflective learners.</p>

      <p>With our <strong>CodeKey™ system</strong>, learning English becomes systemised and structured, so scoring well becomes a predictable outcome — not a matter of luck.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.95em; color: #003366;">
          These powerful strategies are rarely taught elsewhere — but they make a real difference. <br/>
          <strong>Research shows</strong> that students who are coached to reflect on their thinking consistently perform better in exams, and develop stronger confidence in tackling language tasks independently.

      <p><strong>Crack the Code with Strategy</strong></p>
      <p>At Crack the Code Learning, we go beyond rote memorisation. Our Math programme is built to strengthen conceptual understanding while equipping students with the tools to tackle complex word problems confidently and accurately.</p>
      <p>Designed to align with the MOE syllabus, our lessons:</p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
        <li>✔️ Reinforce key mathematical concepts through visual and step-by-step explanations</li>
        <li>✔️ Help students spot common traps and interpret problem types quickly</li>
        <li>✔️ Train students to apply the right <strong>CodeKey™ heuristic</strong> with confidence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We guide students through our unique <strong>R.A.C. Method</strong> — a structured approach to every problem:</p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
        <li>🔍 <strong>R – Read</strong> the question and highlight key information</li>
        <li>🧩 <strong>A – Analyse</strong> what’s being tested and link it to the correct CodeKey™</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>C – Crack</strong> the problem with precision and strategy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By focusing on <em>how</em> to think — not just what to do — CTCL students become agile problem-solvers who approach exams with clarity and confidence.</p>
